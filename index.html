						...maker of all sorts of spectacular. My dad, a maker and heaviest influence in my life ensured the apple didn’t fall too far from the tree. Instead of sticking with one medium for creation, I have had interest and experience in Industrial Design, Mechanical Design, Web, Mobile, Software/Firmware, and (of course—what my degree is in) Electrical. From hands-on machine shop experience to web design I got you covered no matter what your goals. Let’s make dreams into realities!

<h3>3D Rendering Engine</h3>




<p>Using MATALB, this program implements geometry
transformation and lighting calculations to render an image of a scene
consisting of a single 3-D object. The point of this was not “modularity,”
“reuse,” “extensibility,” or “good taste,” but instead a way to understand how
a 3D rendering engine like Direct3D, OpenGL, and XNA handles the behind the
scene stuff. </p>

							<div class="createTextContainer">
Variables:<br />
&#8226;	World-Space XYZ position and RGB value of color light source<br />
&#8226;	Variable RBG color of ambient light<br />
&#8226;	World-space XYZ position of the camera <br />
&#8226;	World-space XYZ position of point camera is looking at.<br />
&#8226;	World-space XYZ position of object and object orientation (represented as rotations around the x,y, and z axis). <br />
&#8226;	&#8216;Field of view&#8217; and the &#8220;near&#8221; and &#8220;far&#8221; distances of the perspective projection viewing frustum.<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
<br />
&#8226;	Represents spatial coordinates as row vectors<br />
&#8226;	Performs respective world, view, and projection transformation to get into normalized coordinates. <br />
&#8226;	Flat lighting model calculates the normal of each triangle to perform diffuse and specular lighting calculations at the center of the triangle. <br />
&#8226;	Performs &#8216;Back-face Culling&#8217; to remove all the faces facing away from the camera.<br />
&#8226;	&#8216;Z-clipping&#8217; removes all facets outside the viewing frustum. <br />
&#8226;	&#8216;Z-sorting&#8217; to remove artifacts that are blocked by other model facets that are in front of them.

							<h3>Box Filter</h3>
							<div class="createTextContainer">
							<p>Problem:<br />
							-Client required a two-pass multi-threaded Gaussian image filter that operates on an EXR image format with single-dimension convolution kernels that produced uniform/isotropic results.</p>
						</div>
						</div>

							<h3>Curve Smoothing</h3>
							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Problem:<br />
							- Low-resolution touch screen to high-resolution printed output leads to a very pixelated overlay of the users &#8216;doodles.&#8217;<br />
							<br />

							
							Cool Facts:<br />
							<br />
							1.	Marketable feature (was on the box) in certain HP printers. <br />
							2.	Living in San Diego assisted with the creative process. <br />
							3.	This was my first time touching algorithms and image processing. I took a 3D Computer Graphics course the following semester because I enjoyed it. <br />
							4.	My own handwriting (as apparent in the images) needs a smoothing algorithm. <br />
							5.	Created when I was 19 years old, during my second college internship. <br />
							<br />
							Tech Specs:<br />
							1.	Uses a combination of B&#233;zie curves, intelligent point averaging, and alpha blending to accomplish the transformation.<br />
							2.	Only allocated by management ~1/7 the amount of memory needed to store a bitmap with the required resolution. <br />
							a.	Overcame this by doing only calculating the part of the image the printer was currently printing.<br />
							3.	Independent R&amp;D feasibility study. Left HP with a finished solution.

							<h3>Stubinator</h3>
							
							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Problem:<br />
							-High volume seller on Stubhub wanted a program to automatically monitor their ticket prices and change them instantly to beat competitors. <br />
							<br />
							Cool Facts:<br />
							&#8226;	Pricing relevant data is modified using Excel creating a brilliant but cost-effective UI. <br />
							&#8226;	Made on Mac, compiling into Windows executable. <br />
							<br />
							Tech Specs:<br />
							&#8226;	Used the following python Libraries: json, time, urllib2, xlrd, xlwt, selenium<br />
							&#8226;	Used py2exe to create Windows executable. <br />
							&#8226;	Coded in Python with ~500 lines of code.

							<h3>MindLink</h3>
							<p>A wireless EEG headset monitors the user's brain activity to manipulate power, channel, and volume on a television. The team designed a custom software program, known as the EmoState Analysis Software, which interfaces and relays the determined command to a custom circuit. Custom electrical hardware manipulates the signals of a modified universal remote control in order to control the television and audio/video (A/V) receivers.</p>

					<div data-panel="panel-6">
						<div>
							<img src="./images/wirelesselec2.jpg" />
							<h3>Wireless Electricity</h3>
							<p>A parallel LC tank-circuit (receiver) is powered by a AC voltage source at the resonant frequency of the receiver circuit.  This creates a large changing magnetic field that induces a current in the receiver powering the light bulb (load).</p>

							<h3>Inertia Navigational Module</h3>
							<p>When your iPhone locates you within a range, that is an INM within your phone locating your position with inaccurate/noisy data and then recursively operating on a stream of noisy data to produce a statically optimal calculation of your actual location. After the initial point, it updates the data using a weighted average with more weight given to estimates with higher certainty. </p>

							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Problem: Client needed hardware to give control systems data about vehicle position and orientation. Current solution was costly and third party.<br />
							<br />
							Fun Facts:<br />
							&#8226;	Learned a lot of cost-saving techniques for board bring-up. <br />
							&#8226;	Beer was provided during the workday and I had recently turned 21. <br />
							<br />
							<br />
							Tech Specs:<br />
							&#8226;	Utilized accelerometer, angular rate (gyroscopic) sensor, and magnetometer (compass) to locate orientation relative to gravity and the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. <br />
							&#8226;	Can be seeded with GPS to give absolute position.

							<h3>Power Supply Validation</h3>
							<p>There is something inherently exciting about sparks and large amounts of electrical power but not to end-users. To ensure nothing bad happens with all this power, tests were conducted on large power supplies for a rack-mounted (5 RU) device. </p>
							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Fun-Facts:<br />
							&#8226;	The magnetic field from the large currents passing through the wires caused the wires to rock back and fourth. <br />
							<br />
							<br />
							Tech Specs:<br />
							&#8226;	Python was used to control an electronic load. <br />
							&#8226;	Used the pyserial library for communication to the electronic load.<br />
							&#8226;	Dual-600W power-supplies in a power-sharing configuration were the DUT (Device Under Test).

							<h3>Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis</h3>
							<p>Ported the existing Tsunami Warning System residing on a buoy tethered to the deepest ocean floors to a sustainable (solar and wave powered), ocean going, robotic vehicle that can autonomously stay in one location. </p>


							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Problem: Cables that tether a buoy to the bottom of the ocean are expensive to maintain. We wanted to replace buoys housing all the communication equipment at the surface of the ocean with WaveGliders&#8212;a marine robot solution. <br />
							<br />
							Fun Facts: <br />
							<br />
							&#8226;	We &#8216;had&#8217; to field test in Hawaii. When was the last time Palo Alto had a Tsunami? <br />
							&#8226;	Doing what you love, saving lives, getting paid&#8212;does it get better?<br />
							&#8226;	This was the first experience with a start-up.<br />
							<br />
							<br />
							Tech Facts:<br />
							<br />
							&#8226;	We used a submersible acoustic modem to monitor and relay the pressure (a large change in pressure means a Tsunami---oh no!) on the deepest parts of the ocean. <br />
							&#8226;	We then used Iridium satellites to relay this data from the ocean to a Tsunami warning station. <br />
							&#8226;	The entire system ran off of renewable fuels (solar and wave power). <br />
							&#8226;	Our goal was

							<h3>BattleBot</h3>
							
							<p>Highly interested in grade school by the TV show Robot Wars and later BattleBots, I set out to build a ‘combat robot’ for my science fair project. Unfortunately, my dad restricted (it was his machine shop ☺) my ability to incorporate ‘weapons’ but I did come out with a pretty killer robot (pun intended). </p>

							<div class="createTextContainer">
							Fun Facts:<br />
							<br />
							&#8226;	Constructed in Grade 9 of secondary school. <br />
							&#8226;	 All material was scrap (except tires)&#8212;9th grade didn&#8217;t allow me a large budget. &#9785;<br />
							&#8226;	Motors were bought at a flea market and previously part of a computer to spin large magnetic tape wheels (a lonnnnnnggggg time ago). <br />
							&#8226;	It can easily knock over my 200lb uncle (hits you low in the shins)&#8212;opps. <br />
							&#8226;	I landed in the local newspaper (Asbury Park Press). <br />
							&#8226;	Fashioned my own gearbox, but I do not know the gearing ratio. I do know it works. <br />

							<br />
							Tech Specs:<br />
							<br />
							&#8226;	Remotely controlled by a Futaba PCM 1024 T6XH RC Airplane Radio Control System. <br />
							&#8226;	Used Futaba servomotors to push micro-switches attached to a metal plate.<br />
							&#8226;	Two switches per motor&#8212;one to move the wheels forward, one to move them backward. <br />
							&#8226;	Turning was accomplished by turning one wheel forward and one wheel backward.<br />
							&#8226;	Battery powered by two car batteries in series (24V) (also recycled) <br />
							&#8226;	Everything was machined out of scrap aluminum.
